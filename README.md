## Abstract 

We propose in this study to analyze how different locale's beer preferences change with regards to the distance between different regions over time. As technology and transportation has increased, for example, we want to see if Canadians may drink more beer from the United States over time because of their relative proximity as opposed to drinking more beer from France since France is further away. Our dataset gives the style for each rating that people drink, and we can also measure how much people from a specific region are drinking each style. We shall investigate many different metrics to check the popularity of different styles of beer over time, such as the styles that are most consumed, the styles with the highest ratings, and the number of breweries which primarily produce a certain style. Our motivation is to see whether countries that are close together geographically have become more interconnected over time through the lens of beer. 

## Research Questions

1. What style of beers have the highest rating, and alternatively, which ones are consumed the most? Among the different categories that are given such as palate, taste, and creativity, what plays the biggest role in determining the style rating and the consumption? Does it differ from region to region? 

2. How does the popularity and style rating for each type of beer change over the years for a specific location? For each region of interest, we want to look at the distribution of beers they are consuming and the beers they are giving the highest ratings to, and see if that is spreading out more with time. 

3. Do some countries mirror the same habits of other countries in terms of the metrics we defined above, and if so, how closely are these countries linked? We especially want to investigate if there is a correlation between the types of beer that they are consuming and the distance between two regions. For example, we'd expect that over time due to increased globalization, Swiss people would get access to more French beer because the two countries are so close in a geographic sense, but it would be more surprising if Americans suddenly started consuming Australian beer. 

4. Can we notice some general trends regarding the distributions of beer that countries consume over time, and how does it shift? Is the world's beer preference in terms of style rating and consumption becoming more homogenous, or are beer preferences still generally confined to a specific region
