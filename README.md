## Abstract 


We propose in this study to analyze the geographic trends of beer in regards to increased globalization over the last 2 decades. As a way to do this, we want to look at how beer in different areas has become more popular over time, and whether certain regions have become more popular with beer in comparison to others from year to year. We think that looking at beer as one specific product can shed light on how different countriesâ€™ products have become more spread out over time, and people who live in one specific country have increasing access to products from all over the world, and how that could have a bearing on ratings.
